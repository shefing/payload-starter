## [Access plugin](./src/plugins/access/accessPlugin.ts)

We wanted to create a plugin which will enable flexibility in setting the user roles

An admin can set [Roles](./src/collections/auth/Roles.ts) according to the organization needs

Roles have a list of permissions

Each permission contains a list of globals/collections, and defines read/write/etc options

For example:
![img.png](img.png)

After defining the roles ,an admin can assign the roles to the users:

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

$${\color{red}??????}$$
//TODO: move 'users', 'roles', 'media' to configuration $${\color{red}??????}$$

**The plugin does the following:**

1. Collects all content types for showing them in the permission drop down.

2. Gos over all the collectiona and globals in the system and assign them the access APIs according to the definition done by Admin.

3. Sets Cell display for createAt and updatedAt fields to use moment.js relation time

## [Author Fields plugin](./src/plugins/author-fields/authorFieldPlugin.ts)

Payload is storing the modification and creation date of each document's collections.

We have the need to store the following as well:

1. User who created or updated the document.
2. Publish date of the document (For publishable content)

All this data is computed and rendered for each collection under Author Data Tab:

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

On list views, dates are presented in moment.js relation format like:

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

## [Comments plugin](./src/plugins/CommentsPlugin.ts)

We wanted to create a plugin which will enable the ability to add comments between users over a text from RichText field

The user can add comment on selected text to start a discussion about this content:

![img_4.png](img_4.png)

Comments section is available on the right side of the screen and users can reply or delete comment

![img_5.png](img_5.png)

In addition, there is highlight mark on text that has comments

![img_6.png](img_6.png)

```

```
